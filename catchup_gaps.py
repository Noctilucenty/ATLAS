"""Gap-catchup collector - the Windows replacement for the Mac's catchup.sh.

The supervisor collects a fixed 2-hour window hourly, so any outage longer
than that (sleep, reboot, network loss) leaves a PERMANENT hole in
market.duckdb - the broker only serves ~60 days, and holes cannot be
refilled later. This sidecar runs every 6 h from Task Scheduler
(ATLAS-catchup, pythonw, no window): it measures the newest candle per
asset and, when the gap exceeds the supervisor's own reach, collects a
window big enough to heal it (capped at 168 h; the broker serves it).

Assets: the full frozen trading universe plus the extra-collection set.
Data-only; touches no execution or hypothesis code.
