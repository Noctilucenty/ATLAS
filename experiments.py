"""Append-only experiment ledger.

Every training run - kept or rejected - appends one JSON line. Nothing is
ever rewritten, so the ledger is the honest record of how many variants were
attempted against a dataset (the denominator backtest-overfitting math needs).
Each entry pins full provenance: dataset content hash, source commit, feature
code hash, dependency lock hash, complete parameters, fold time ranges and
payout source.
