"""Mission Control core - shared read-only data layer for status.py,
dashboard.py and watchdog.py on the always-on Windows host.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-mission-control-design.md):
- Read-only against ALL trading state: market.duckdb is opened read_only,
  journal.db via sqlite URI mode=ro, jsonl logs are only ever read.
- Never evaluates the pre-registered forward-test criteria. Counts and
  displays only; forward_eval.py runs ONCE, by hand, after the window.
- Imports nothing from the signal path (no features/train/analyzer imports).

The candle-label computation here is the LABEL-FIDELITY TRACKER: an
approximation (close of the decision bar vs close of the bar ending nearest
entry+expiry) whose whole purpose is to be compared against the broker's
settled verdict. Disagreement is the measurement, not an error.
